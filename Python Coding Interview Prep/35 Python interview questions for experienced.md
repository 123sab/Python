### The keyword in Python can turn any function into a generator. Yields work like a standard return keyword.

def days(index):
    day = ['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St']            
    yield day[index]    
    yield day[index+1]

### When we want to convert a list into a string, we can use the <.join()> method which joins all the elements into one and returns as a string.

```python
days = ['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St'] 
ltos = ' '.join(days)
print(ltos)

> S M T W Tr F St
