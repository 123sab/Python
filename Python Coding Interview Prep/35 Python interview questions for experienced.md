## 1. Debugging a Python Program

```python
# By using this command we can debug a python program
python -m pdb python-script.py
```

## 2. Yield Keyword in Python
### The keyword in Python can turn any function into a generator. Yields work like a standard return keyword.

```python
def days(index):
    day = ['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St']            
    yield day[index]    
    yield day[index+1]  
  
res = days(0)
print(next(res), next(res))

> S M
```

## 3. Converting a List into a String
### When we want to convert a list into a string, we can use the `<.join()>` method which joins all the elements into one and returns as a string.

```python
days = ['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St'] 
ltos = ' '.join(days)
print(ltos)

> S M T W Tr F St
```

## 4. Converting a List into a Tuple
### By using Python `<tuple()>` function we can convert a list into a tuple. But we canâ€™t change the list after turning it into tuple, because it becomes immutable.

```python
days = ['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St'] 
ltos = tuple(days)
print(ltos)

> ('S', 'M', 'T', 'W', 'Tr', 'F', 'St')
```

## 5. Counting the occurrences of a particular element in the list
### We can count the occurrences of an individual element by using a `<count()>` function.

```python
days = ['S','M','W', 'M','M','F','S']

print(days.count('M'))

> 3
```
