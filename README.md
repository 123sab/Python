<b align = "justify"> Also this repository gives to enough knowledge about python programming and also helps you to survive in this programming world !!! </b>

# Installation tools

### Below are some tools that you can download before getting started with Python, now itâ€™s a preference, so download whichever that fits the best for you.

| Name of the tools | 
| ------------- |
|[Python download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)|
|[Pycharm download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)|
|[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)|
|[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)|

<p align="justify"> For those of you who aren't aware of Pycharm: PyCharm is an integrated development environment used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. It is developed by the Czech company JetBrains (Psss, copied from Wikipedia).</p>

<p align = "justify">I personally use Google Colab for python programming. It's one of the best interactive tool in the world. I like it because I can provide more documentation to the code and write some quality tutorials.</p>

# Nbviewer

<b align = "justify">If the jupyter notebook doesn't load. Don't worry just copy and paste the link to [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org). Because most of my jupyter notebooks are not loading.</b>



# Contributors

<p align="justify"> Tanu Nanda Prabhu : This is me, I'm doing my Master's in Computer Science, at University of Regina, Canada. Although I'm good at programming, definitely not a code monkey. I like to document each and every line of code and help others understand it. It is very important to document the code. I believe that I learn simultaneously while I teach you guys in this repository. Special thanks to Udemy, it is with the help of their guidance, I could learn Python at a high level.</p>
