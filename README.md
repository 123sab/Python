Tanu Nanda Prabhu : This is me, I'm doing my Master's in Computer Science, at University of Regina, Canada. Although I'm good at programming, definitely not a code monkey. I like to document each and every line of code and help others understand it. It is very important to document the code. I believe that I learn simultaneously while I teach you guys in this repository. Special thanks to Udemy, it is with the help of their guidance, I could learn Python at a high level. All the turorials are referred from their notes
